ratty,"You're a bit basic. But you know what you like! The ratty gives you the choices to be confident you can find something good to eat at any given meal. In line with this consistency, you consistently wake up at ungodly hours to make your way to breakfast. I could never.","Your favorite meal is lunch. And your favorite place to eat is the Ratty. How original! But, hey, sometimes basic is better. If you like the variety of options the Ratty provides and are willing to endure the noon rush, who am I to tell you where to eat. As long as you can get a table...","Your favorite meal is dinner. And your favorite place to eat is the Ratty. How original! But, hey, sometimes basic is better. If you like the variety the Ratty provides and are willing to endure the 6 PM rush, who am I to tell you where to eat. As long as you can get a table...

andrews,"Sometimes it's nice to not have to choose. Andrews gives you that. You've grown accustomed to salmon, poke, and burrito bowls, and that's what Andrews gives you day in and day out. Except in the morning. Somehow, despite Andrews' never serving breakfast, that's your favorite meal. Maybe you hit v-dub for breakfast. North campus behavior.","Well, yes. But, no. It's really you doing the eating I suppose. Andrews is a dining hall best known for easy, tasty, takeout lunch options. And that's just what you use it for. Sometimes it's a bit of an extra hike from the lecture hall, but the consistency of an Andrews noodle or poke bowl is worth it for a scrumptious lunch. To say nothing of the Andrews burrito bowl's clear dominance of the weekend lunch scene.","Who eats dinner at Andrews?? You, I guess. That's true commitment to the Andrews experience. Maybe you live conveniently above in the homonymous dorm and just don't want to go out in the cold. Or maybe you trecked across from South campus. Either way, you know what you want for dinner, and you get it at Andrews. Or you just like the pizza better than a Ratty slice. Incorrect opinion, but you do you.",IMPOSSIBLE
vdub,There are two places to get breakfast on campus. You chose the niche one. But probably the better one! I don't see a waffle maker at the Ratty daily... Sometimes you just want to start the day with a fruit salad and a dream. You can do that V-Dub.,"What. A. Valid. Choice. V-Dub lunch is criminally underrated. But you and I know what’s up. Whether it’s Monday chicken Caesar wraps, a run at the best salad bar at Brown, or literally just a waffle, you’re in for a quality meal to refuel you between classes. Excellent call.",V-Dub serves the same stuff every day of the week for dinner. And you eat it up. Good for you! Those bowls are simply immaculate. Add that to a solid salad bar and some vegetable sides and you’ve got yourself an excellent dinner. Great choice.,IMPOSSIBLE
jos,"You know Jo's doesn't serve breakfast right? Or lunch? Guess you have a varied pallette. Your favorite meal is at the beginning of the day, and yet your favorite food spot doesn't open until 6PM. A paradox to be sure, but maybe that speaks to you as a person. You probably just go to Jo's for the Chobani and cereal.",IMPOSSIBLE,"Perhaps you have sports practice until 8. Or you can't be bothered to get to the Ratty by 7:30. Or maybe you just want a good ol' spicy with to cap off your day.  Either way, you love Jo's, and Jo's loves you.",Classic. Nothing hits quite like a midnight Jo’s run. And that’s where we’ll find you. Every. Single. Day. Okay maybe not literally every day. Not that I’d be offended if you did—Jo’s serves up everything from fruit salads to quesadillas to chocolate chip cookies—why shouldn’t you eat there exclusively?
ivy,IMPOSSIBLE,"You could get lunch anywhere on campus. And you chose...Ivy?? Those chicken caesers are pretty excellent I must admit. But unless you're eating 7 chicken ceasers a week (defensible), it's hard to understand why you don't just take the stairs up into the far more varied ratty. Maybe you just love fig newtons. Fig off.","When you entered the Ratty doors, you made a brave decision. You went down. Hope that paid off for you! Chicken and waffles night is great I’ll give you that. Or maybe you were just fiending for a smoothie. I can forgive it.",Most people go to Jo’s late at night. Not you. You just haaaad to be different. Maybe you just love smoothies. Or you’re pulling a pickup breakfast the night before kinda situation and stashing those smoothies in your fridge. Or you just love fig newtons. You do you…
